# Linked List
A linked list is a et of ordered data elements each containing a link to its successor and sometimes its predecessor.

## Operations
* **Traversal** - access each element of the linked list
* **Insertion** - adds a new element to the linked list
* **Deletion** - removes the existing elements

* **Search** - find a node in the linked list

* **Sort** - sort the nodes of the linked list

## Keywords
`head`: points to the first node of the linkedlist

`next`: points to the next node in the linked list. 
**Note** If `next` is `NULL` then we have reached the end of the linkedlist.
